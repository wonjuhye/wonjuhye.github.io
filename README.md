# Day by Day


## Who am I?

This theme is inspired by [sphinx-rtd-theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme) and refactored with:

- [@primer/css](https://github.com/primer/css)
- [github-pages](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) ([dependency versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/))

## What I do now

```yml
remote_theme: rundocs/jekyll-rtd-theme
```

You can [generate](https://github.com/rundocs/starter-slim/generate) with the same files and folders from [rundocs/starter-slim](https://github.com/rundocs/starter-slim/)
